# Custom RES Macro, BBTimestamps
#### Creates a shortcut for posting timestamps in BBT/PST, quickly and easily.

This macro is designed specifically to be used **with** the [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/).
The code I've drawn up must be placed in one of the config files for RES stored locally on your personal computer--therefore **I do not recommend** trying this without a working basic knowledge of computers and computer files.

#### When used, the time stamp will look like this:

---
**\#TS** : MON 7/13 @ **08:52:31 AM** PST/BBT, CAM ? 

> [ this area is empty, ready for your description, summary, or remarks on the events at hand. ]
