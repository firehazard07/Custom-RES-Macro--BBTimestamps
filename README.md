# Custom RES Macro, BBTimestamps
#### Creates a shortcut for posting timestamps in BBT/PST, quickly and easily.

This macro is designed specifically to be used **with** the [Reddit Enhancement Suite](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/).
The code I've drawn up must be placed in one of the config files for RES stored locally on your personal computer--therefore **I do not recommend** trying this without a working basic knowledge of computers and computer files.

#### When used, the time stamp will look like this:

---
**\#TS** : MON 7/13 @ **08:52:31 AM** PST/BBT, CAM ? 

> [ this area is empty, ready for your description, summary, or remarks on the events at hand. Things in the Big Brother house change quickly, and a full date/time/camera timestamp is only 2 clicks away with this macro installed.]

---

#### Installation Process (Chrome, Windows 7+)
1. Have RES installed
2. Find "commentTools.js" 
`Filepath: C:\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Extensions\kbmg(...)gmb\4.5.4_0\modules\commentTools.js`
3. Back up the file before messing with it
4. Open it in an editing program like Notepad++
5. Open BBTSMacro_compact.txt from this site
5. Copy the code from BBTSMacro_compact.txt, paste it into line 747
6. Save "commentTools.js"
8. Close all instances of Chrome, if open
9. Reopen Chrome to any Reddit page, and the BBT Timestamp shortcut will be under the macro drop-down menu.
